[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/low-http-server.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/low-http-server)  
HTTP server implementation for Node.js based on [uWebSockets.js](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js)!
> Formerly part of the [0http](https://github.com/jkyberneees/0http) project!

## Introduction

`low-http-server` is a Node.js wrapper around the great [uWebSockets.js](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js) library. Here, I/O throughput is maximized at the cost of API compatibility, when we compare it to the standard Node.js HTTP server interface.
> As far as Node.js stands, `uWebSockets.js` brings the best I/O performance in terms of HTTP servers.

```js
const server = require('low-http-server')({})
server.on('request', (req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello World!')
})

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000')
})

```

Or with SSL:
```javascript
const server = require('low-http-server')({
  cert_file_name: './demos/test.crt',
  key_file_name: './demos/test.key',
  passphrase: 'test'
})

server.on('request', (req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello World!')
})

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000')
})
```

## Benchmarks

> Machine: MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020), 1,4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5  
> Node.js version: 12.18.3

```bash
wrk -t8 -c40 -d5s http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

- [low-http-server](demos/basic.js): **106630.22 reqs/s**
- [node http cluster](demos/cluster-node-http.js): 87729.42 reqs/s
- [node http](demos/basic-node-http.js): 65807.49 reqs/s

Take note that low-http-server does not clusterize on anything [besides reasonably recent versions of Linux kernel](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js/issues/214#issuecomment-547589050). You may deploy several instances listening on different IPs and being proxied (e.g. by nginx) as a workaround. 

Clusterization could be possibly implemented, as soon as uWebSockets.js gets support for listening to a socket.

## Known limitations
- Limited compatibility with Node.js standard interface. 

## Integrations
### General notes

Low-http-server has become more compatible with Node.js standard interface, but it is not perfect. Despite certain quirks, low-http-server can often replace the usual node `http` module backend and serve as an underlying server for popular node.js frameworks. There are only two known requirements: 

* The framework doesn't rely on deprecated `Object.setPrototypeOf` to add new properties to the `request` and `response` objects. This is because our `request` and `response` provide similar APIs, but are inherently different in their internals. They cannot be replaced with an essentialy incompatible foreign Prototype. This means that Express is currently incompatible (see [Express `init` middleware](https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/508936853a6e311099c9985d4c11a4b1b8f6af07/lib/middleware/init.js#L35)).
* The HTTP handler function is **NOT** prioritized using `setImmediate` . Otherwise, low-http-server will work, but perforfmance will suffer tremendously. For example, in Restana you are going to need `prioRequestsProcessing` framework option set to `false`

### 0http framework

```js
const low = require('low-http-server')
const cero = require('0http')

const { router, server } = cero({
  server: low()
})

router.get('/hi', (req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello World!')
})

server.listen(3000, (socket) => {
  if (socket) {
    console.log('HTTP server ready!')
  }
})
```



### restana framework

No problems, if `prioRequestsProcessing` is set to false.

```js
const server = require('low-http-server')({})

const service = require('restana')({
  server: server,
  prioRequestsProcessing: false // NOTE: required for restana integration
})

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000')
})

service.get('/', (req,res) => {
  res.send('It works!')
})
```



### Fastify

- Broken in current release.



### Other frameworks

Please refer to their documentation on how to use your own server.
